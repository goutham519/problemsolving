// maximum substring
sliding window - two pointer with hashmap containing the each with index
and make left = max(left,elementindex+1) if some element is found on map


// fruits in the basket of 2 types
max substring with 2 elements
use map to store the elements and count then trim down until map size is equal to 2

//Binary subarray with sum
use two iterations
one to find the number of combos greater than sum
one to find the number of combos greater than sum-1
then get the diff b/w above two to find number of combos equal to sum.

//nice subarray - change it binary subarray by ,moduling by 2


//Number of substring containing all three characters
use hm to store index of the character

see if all present and get the least one and add the least one index to sum ,so all combos will be there

//Longest Substring With At Most K Distinct Characters
max substring with 2 elements
use map to store the elements and count then trim down until map size is equal to 2
